%-------Symbol mapping and demapping-----

%-------Nyquist Filter------------

% 1 MHz cutoff fre-quency
% 0.3 roll-off factor  
% Before filtering, the symbol sequence is over-sampled with a factor M >
% 1.
% The sample rate fixes the bandwidth simulated in Matlab, that must be high
% enough to simulate the halfroot Nyquist filtering.
